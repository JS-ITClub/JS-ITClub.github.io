## Club Meetings

IT Club meetings are held in Mr. Alexander's room B248 every Friday during SHORE


## Who we are

The IT Club was dormant for many years until 2014-2015 when a new generation of networking students took the reins and pushed to have a LAN party fundraiser. Now, the IT Club is still growing, looking to establish itself as bigger and better. The JS IT Club is composed of many members of Jersey Shore's networking program who are interested in sharing the wonders of networking and programming with fellow students. Many of us have interests ranging from networking, to graphic design, sound design, web development, programming, and let's not forget, video games!


## What we do

Since we are trying to fund students exams, one thing we have to do is raise money. We have had much success in the past through the LAN parties. And we hope to continue these LAN parties in the future.

IT Club is a new club independent from any national organization. This means that as a club we can do what we want - academically that is, as well as placing high value on suggestions from our members to make the club better.


## Why you should join

If you are interested in a career that involves computers (and let's be fair - in today's world, most careers do) then our club is perfect for you!

Interested in video games? IT Club is a fun way to learn about aspects of computers and get involved with the local gaming community (through LAN parties and meeting people interested in computers)

Interested in programming? Through IT Club you can learn about programming courses offered at the high school and meet others who are interested in programming as well.

### Our Goals

Fund networking students certification exams
Provide an intuitive inroad for students to get involved in the world of computers and information technologies
Introduce students to networking
Host fun, computer centered events for students to participate in
